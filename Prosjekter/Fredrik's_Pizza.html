                <td> Enough Dough to make a pizza you feel is enough for yourself, enough spoons of Sauce until you cover the dough mostly, in at least a thin layer of sauce and then you sprinkle som shredded cheese over it, enough to make yourself happy! </td>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take out the dough, and roll it out to get it in a nice circle shape, thick or thin, you decide, just rememeber to calculate the heat differently if you have a thin dough bottom or if you have a thick one.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your tomato sauce and start taking a few spoonfulls of tomato sauce onto the pizza, make sure get a nice layer, again you decide how much you want, just don't put it all the way to the sides, because it'll get messy.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Now just sprinkle some cheesy goodness all over the top of your pizza and voilà, you're pizza is almost finished!<br><br>
        
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Put that baby in the oven (NOT an actual baby, but the pizza), and make sure to have it at around 200 degrees CELSIUS, and then depending on the thickness of your pizza it'll take between 10-20 minutes for it to cook, just check on it a little here and there and it'll be fine. Bon appétit! (If it don't cook, put up the degrees, but don't overdo it.)
